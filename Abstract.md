What do faculty members know about universal design and digital accessibility? A qualitative study in computer science and engineering disciplines

This paper presents research from Norun Christine Sanderson which was conducted in Norway and Poland and which attempted to identify qualitative measures of 

The paper begins with its own abstract, identifying the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions of the research.

As this research was conducted within a European context, the paper makes reference several times to the state of legislation regarding education accessability in Europe, which may not be entirely relevent to the context of the U.S. However, the research and conclusions can still be adapted to a more local context.

The paper is divided into seven sections.
Section 1 is the introduction, and provides a breif overview of the structure of the paper and its motive.

Section 2 covers the concept of Universal Design (as defined in the Norwegian Equality and Anti-discrimination Act), and the relevant legislation relating to the adherence to accessibility standards in higher education.

Section 3 discusses related research into the same subject matter by prior papers. It explores the levels of knowledgeability about and attitudes towards issues of disability and accessibility at higher learning institutions, primarily through the use of references to other papers on the topic. (much of the research presented is from the U.S., which does not have the same laws as are discussed in sections 1 and 2, so it may not be fair to use the findings of US studies to say that more training is necessary in Europe.)

The sample size for this study seems to be very small, 

Section 4 describes the methods used by the researchers. In short, they conducted interviews with 35 faculty members from Computer Science and Engineering departments at schools in Poland and Norway. These interviews focused on evaluating each individual's knowledge and expertise. 

Section 5 splits the results into two themes, theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge.
The results are thorough in describing each category of accessibility concerns and addressing both the knowledgeability and blind spots of the participants. There seems to have been a much larger focus in the questioning on Computer Science and technology accessibility than on concerns related specifically to other fields of engineering.
In the realm of practical knowledge, the researchers seemed to be more concerned with the participants' knowledge of formal practical guidlines rather than real historical experience.

Section 6 provides a brief discussion of the results of the two major themes of the results section (theoretical and practical knowledge), and a reflection on the implications and limitations of the study. The researchers do seem to expect more of those in the field of Computer Science as they presume that a higher level of familiarity and expertise with technology should entail a greater knowledge of how to leverage that technology for creating accessibile course materials.





For this assignment, I read a paper titled 
"What do faculty members know about universal design and digital accessibility?
A qualitative study in computer science and engineering disciplines"
This was a research paper, where the research project was conducted in Poland and Norway in a couple of universities where they took members of faculty from the computer science and engineering departments and conducted a series of interviews where they tried to get a feel for how much the faculty were knowledgeable about, or the attitudes and dispositions were towards the issues of accessibility and disability services at the universities. And this paper is really divided up into seven sections, with an introduction, a section that covers the concepts of universal design, which is the idea of designing things in such a way that anyone is able to use them and access those resources. Section 3 discusses prior research that was in the same field, and section4 discusses the methods that they used in this research project. This is probably the most interesting part of the paper as well as section 5, which goes over the specific results that they found during their research. To speak briefly about the methods, basically as I said, they conducted a series of interviews with 35 different faculty members, and most of them were from a computer science discipline, while a few of them were taken from an engineering department, and they were quizzed over, well they were asked to express their view of what barriers that people with disabilities experienced in regards to technology access in these disciplines, and to recount ways in which they had knowledge of ways to remediate these issues, or help with the specific struggles that disabled students face. In section 5 they go over the specific discussion that they had with each of these professors and go really in depth on what their different answers were, but I guess more importantly, for the takeaway, was section 6, where they have a brief discussion over the whole topic and talk about the results on a more meta level, and what it means for the EU as a whole, because they talk about the laws and legislation in the EU regarding accessibility and disabilities, and their conclusion is that these aren't really being lived up to in practice because teachers and educators oftentimes don't have all of the knowledge or resources that they need in order to actually satisfy the requirements of the legislation. All in all, I thought it was a very interesting read, and while I'm not in 100 percent agreement with all of the conclusions they come to, I think it provides a very valuable look into the topic.
