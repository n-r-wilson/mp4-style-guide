Hi, my name is Noah Wilson, I'm from Sherwood Arkansas, and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science. My future career will most likely be in programming, although I don't know exactly what or where yet.

Technical writing is a major part of a programming job, whether that's writing documentation for code or doing project planning and coordination. I don't anticipate being int he position to be writing project specifications or planning documents right off the bat, but I will definintely be writing a lot of code documentation.

From what I've heard about programming jobs, writing documentation may be an even larger component of programming than just writing the code itself, since a few lines of code may require an entire paragraph to document. I've been experiencing this myself in one of my personal programming projects right now. For quite a while, I neglected to write proper documentation, and now I'm trying to fix that by going back through thousands of lines of code to write proper explainations of each part. And it's been quite challenging to summarize certain functions in the program as concisely as possible.

In a team project, technical writing skills are even more essential, since like I mentioned above, the writing needs to be clear enough that it can be understood by all members of the team. 

Often, your documentation may even outlive the actual code that you write, because as the project evolves certain parts are bound to change, get rewritten, or even be removed entirely. But the documentation of these changes will always be relevant as it conveys the motivation and reasoning behing each change. Everything in a large codebase needs to be written with the intention of being passed down to others who will need to be able to understand what was written and why. I assume most of this documentation will be in plain text, however charts and graphs may be used when cataloguing performance metrics for a program.

And I think having the technical knowledge of how to make your writing clear and concise is one of the most important aspects to achieving this, so I look forward to learning techniques in this class that will help me with that goal.
